# Scenario Walk-Through

1. The program asks for course info.
i. Courses the user intends to take associated info for the respective courses.
    * We will give value to each segment for the purpose of the walk-through.
    * We will allow for multiple inputs for the below info but the program will
    take only one for the purpose of the walk-through.
   (1) Course name: CSC207H1F
   (2) Delivery method: Online/In-Person Sync
   (3) Time span info: 6.00/8.00/THUR
   (4) Instructor: Lindsey Shorser
   (5) Location: Online
   * The program will ask for any tut/lab/pra under each course 
   and treat lec and tut/lab/pra equally, as they take the same precedence 
   when it comes to allocating time. 
ii. Any preferences info the user provides when prompted.
   * The user will put no for any preferences for the purpose of the 
   run-through.

3. The program runs based on the info provided by the user. 
i. The program will generate timetables for each preference provided by the user. 
    * In this case, there is no preference.
ii. The program will store the generated timetables.
    * In this case, there will only be one timetable for the one course.
iii. The program will generate a List of timetables based on the userâ€™s priority 
   input we obtained in the last section.
    * In the case, there is no preference hence no priority input.

4. The program reports to the user.
i. A collection of formatted timetables will be displayed to the user as terminal 
    commands.
    * In this case, only one timetable is displayed for the one course.
