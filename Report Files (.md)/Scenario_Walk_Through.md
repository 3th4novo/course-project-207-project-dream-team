# Scenario Walk-Through

1. The program asks for course info.

   (i) Courses the user intends to take associated info for the respective courses.
   
   (*) We will give value to each segment for the purpose of the walk-through.
   
   (*) We will allow for multiple inputs for the below info but the program will
    take only one course for the purpose of the walk-through.
       
       (1) Number of courses: 1
       
       (2) Course code: CSC207H1F
   
       (3) Type: LEC
   
       (4) Instructor: Lindsey Shorsern
   
       (5) Day of week: 4
   
       (6) Start time: 18

       (7) End time: 20

   (ii) Any preference info the user provides when prompted.
   
   (*) The user will put no for any preferences for the purpose of the 
         run-through.


2. The program runs based on the info provided by the user. 

   (i) The program will generate timetables for each preference provided by the user.
   
   (*) In this case, there is no preference.

   (ii) The program will store the generated timetables.
   
   (*) In this case, there will only be one timetable for the one course.

   (iii) The program will generate a List of timetables based on the userâ€™s priority 
   input we obtained in the last section.
   
   (*) In this case, there is no preference hence no priority input.


3. The program reports to the user.

   i. A collection of formatted timetables will be displayed to the user as terminal 
    commands.
   
   (*) In this case, only one timetable is displayed for the one course.
