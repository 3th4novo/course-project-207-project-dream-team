#Progress Report

## Software Design
We aim to design a timetable management software that allows the users to schedule their course.

Whether the program can schedule one's personal activities or estimate the walk-time between classes is yet to be discussed.

## Classes
- Course:
- CourseManage
- Scheduler (Super Class)
- BackToBackScheduler (Child Class)
- ProfPreferenceScheduler (Child Class)
- DurationScheduler (Child Class):
- TimeTable: represent a particular table and show it to the users.
