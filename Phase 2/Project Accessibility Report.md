1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

   - (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

   - (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

- Principle 1: Equitable Use
- Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

3. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your 
program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who 
like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

- We would market our program towards undergraduate students from University of Toronto, since our algorithms are based
on undergraduate course code, and the course code of undergraduate (e.g. CSC207H1F) courses and graduate courses 
(e.g. CSC227F) are different. When our customers type in the course code of their wanted courses, our algorithms will 
autofill other basic information including time and instructor of the courses, as long as the course can be found on 
the University of Toronto Course Finder. Besides, we have not included any course information for other schools, 
so we limit our customers to University of Toronto. 


5. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 
For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to 
be used by people who do not read braille.
