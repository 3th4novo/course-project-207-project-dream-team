#Project Accessibility Report

1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

   - Principle 1: Equitable Use
     - All undergraduate students from UofT can equally use the programs. But our program is not available for students from other schools.
     - Our program should be appealing to students because they don't have to organize the timetables themselves. 
     - For all users, we provide the same provision of privacy, security, and safety.
   - Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
     - Users only need to type in the course code for a course, the algorithms will provide other basic information about the
     courses (e.g. time, instructors). So our program facilitates the user's accuracy and precision.
     - We have a high-contrast mode, so people with visual deficit can choose the use our programs by this mode.
   - Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
     - Our program is easy to use. The users only need to do is type in their courses and choose the preferences.
     - Users will get the timetables meet their preferences after they provide the necessary information, which is very straightforward and intuitive.
   - Principle 4: Perceptible Information
     - We provide a high-contrast mode for people with visual deficit.
     - We clearly separate our function button (e.g. knit to CSV) with the output (i.e. timetable) on our user interphase.
   - Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
     - On the user interface, the course search bar occupies the left side of the interface with a relatively large space, which is obvious and easy to use.
     - We only allow the user to type in their courses and choose preference, or remove courses that are inputted accidently. Any behaviors that would 
     interrupt the running of program or mass up the output is not allowed since the users has no access the inner algorithms.
   - Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
     - Running our project does not need a lot of physical effort. 
     - Users are able to maintain a neutral body position while using our program -- simply sitting in front of the computer.
   - Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
     - Our project is a computer based program. Therefore, we did not take this principle into account because it should be considered 
     more in the external design for computer (e.g. size, material).

2. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your 
program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who 
like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

   - We would market our program towards undergraduate students from University of Toronto, since our algorithms are based
   on undergraduate course code, and the course code of undergraduate (e.g. CSC207H1F) courses and graduate courses 
   (e.g. CSC227F) are different. When our customers type in the course code of their wanted courses, our algorithms will 
   autofill other basic information including time and instructor of the courses, as long as the course can be found on 
   the University of Toronto Course Finder. Besides, we have not included any course information for other schools, 
   so we limit our customers to University of Toronto. 


3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 
For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to 
be used by people who do not read braille.

   - Our project is less likely to be used by individuals who are not students. Our project is designed to schedule 
   appropriate course timetables based on the provided courses and user preferences, which is only necessary for students. 
   Individuals other than students do not have to schedule course timetables. More over, our algorithms only provide 
   services for University of Toronto students at the current stage because we only find the corresponding course information
   for UofT students. But we can add course information for other school later. Therefore, it is possible that our project 
   can be used by students from other school in the future, but it will never be an appropriate program for individuals 
   other than students.
